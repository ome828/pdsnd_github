>**Note**: Please **fork** the current Udacity repository so that you will have a **remote** repository in **your** Github account. Clone the remote repository to your local machine. Later, as a part of the project "Post your Work on Github", you will push your proposed changes to the remote repository in your Github account.

# Introduction
This is the documentation file for the Udacity **Programming for Data Science Nano-degree Final Project** - _Post Your Work on GitHub_. The information below will detail logistical information about the work I've done for the **US Bikeshare** Python project. 
### Date created
This project was created on GitHub on January 4, 2024. The Bikeshare submission itself was submitted to Udacity on January 2, 2024 and this README file was created on January 4, 2024 as well.

### US Bikeshare Data

### Description
This is a project meant to be run on the terminal that requests the user to input filters (through answering prompts) and uses information from csv files to output **concise conclusions**. The user will gain insight into questions such as the duration of trips, the most popular stations & even the oldest / youngest travelers recorded for these trips. 

### Files used

* bikeshare.py
* chicago.csv, new_york_city.csv, washington.csv (included in .gitignore)
* README.md

### IDE
Udacity supplies a workspace terminal and IDE on their Nanodegree portal so I used a mix of that IDE and Pycharm + Terminal on MacOS for this project.

### Credits
Stack Overflow and many blog posts have helped me to complete this project. The links I consulted for my project are listed below:
